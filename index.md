### Bio

Hello! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at The University of Texas at Austin, specializing in American politics and political behavior. My research is focused on the carceral state and its behavioral consequences, specifically when it comes to the political participation of custodial citizens.

I have been a Graduate Research Fellow with the [Irma Rangel Public Policy Institute](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/ppi/) since 2020. I hold an MA in Government from University of Texas at Austin, and a BSc in Political Science, Economics and Statistics from Lund University in Sweden.
