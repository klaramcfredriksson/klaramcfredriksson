# Add your own content

To add pages to your site, you can either write a markdown file (`.md`) or you can write an HTML file. It's much easier to write markdown than HTML, so that's the recommended approach ([here's a great tutorial](https://markdowntutorial.com/) if you need to learn markdown in 5 minutes).

Any markdown or HTML file that you create will be available on your website under `https://<yourusername>.github.io/<pagename>`. For example, if you create a file `about.md` (or `about.html`) then it'll exist at `https://<yourusername>.github.io/about`.

Files you create inside the [`_posts`](./_posts) directory will be treated as blog entries. You can look at the existing files there to get an idea of how to write blog posts. Note the format of the blog post files - they must follow the naming convention of `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md`. After you successfully add your own post, you can delete the existing files inside [`_posts`](./_posts) to remove the sample posts, as those are just demo posts to help you learn.

# Customizing parameters for each page

```

---
```

**Important takeaway: ALWAYS add the YAML front matter, which is two lines of three dashes, to EVERY page. If you have any parameters, they go between the two lines.**

## Main parameters

These are the basic YAML parameters that you are most likely to use on most pages.

Parameter   | Description
----------- | -----------
title       | Page or blog post title
subtitle    | Short description of page or blog post that goes under the title
tags        | List of tags to categorize the post. Separate the tags with commas and place them inside square brackets. Example: `[personal, analysis, finance]`
cover-img   | Include a large full-width image at the top of the page. You can either provide the path to a single image (eg. `"/path/to/img"`) , or a list of images to cycle through (eg. `["/path/img1", "/path/img2"]`). If you want to add a caption to an image, then you must use the list notation (use `[]` even if you have only one image), and each image should be provided as `"/path/to/img" : "Caption of image"`.
thumbnail-img | For blog posts, if you want to add a thumbnail that will show up in the feed, use `thumbnail-img: /path/to/image`. If no thumbnail is provided, then `cover-img` will be used as the thumbnail. You can use `thumbnail-img: ""` to disable a thumbnail.
