### Bio

Hello and welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at The University of Texas at Austin. I study the politics of business, primarily at the international level; topics of particular interest include international economic law, taxation, public-private governance, and diplomacy. Some of my work has been published in <i>International Organization</i>, <i>The Review of International Organizations</i>, <i>Business and Politics</i>, and <i>AEA: Papers and Proceedings</i>. Starting in Fall 2022, I'll be a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University's <a href="https://niehaus.princeton.edu/">Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance</a>; in Fall 2023, I will join Columbia University's <a href="https://polisci.columbia.edu/">Political Science Department</a> as Assistant Professor, where I will also be associated with the <a href="https://www.siwps.org/programs/the-politics-and-global-economy-page-lab/">Politics and the Global Economy (PaGE) Lab</a> at the Saltzman Institute.
